# ACTAM - Hack the Beat: Song Recreation in the Browser
## 27/11/2024

---

## Goal

- To design and code a web page that plays a reinterpretation of a song
- with varying levels of fidelity
- and using tools like Tone.js or the Web Audio API.

---

## Two options

1) **Carillon**: user clicks on a play button to listen to the entire song reinterpretation
2) **DiscJokey**: user can interact with or even manipulate parts of the song

---

## How we'll assign points

- Option Carillon, 2 pts: cover of song sections, degree of musical creativity, code elegance

- Option DiscJokey, 2 pts: degree of interactivity, glitches minimization, fun user experience

- yes, it's possible to aim for 4 pts

## Tips for the song to be revealed..
- Intro (0:00-1:00): Minimalist beat that builds tension
- Main Bridge (1:00-1:30): Introduction of the piano riff
- Breakdown (1:30-2:15): Removal of drums, focusing on the piano
- Build-up (2:15-2:45): Gradual return of rhythmic elements
- Main Drop (2:45-4:15): Full energy with all elements
- Outro (4:15-end): Gradual deconstruction
